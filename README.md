#Nuke#
###The Fast, Simple ATOM Implementation###

##What is it?##

Nuke is a simple ATOM implementation built ontop of a SAX parser and a StAX writer designed for simplicity, immutibility and memory efficiency. The project also aspires to maintain a minimal dependency footprint.

Nuke also contains a very simple listener style ATOM client designed specifically to work with [AtomHopper](http://atomhopper.org/).
